# Single-Cycle-Processor-MIPS-
OVERVIEW
# Architecture:
The single-cycle MIPS processor was designed to execute MIPS instructions within a single clock cycle, prioritizing simplicity and performance. The architecture includes core components such as the Program Counter (PC), Instruction Memory, Control Unit, Register File, ALU, Data Memory, and Sign-Extender. Each module was implemented in Verilog HDL, adhering closely to the MIPS instruction set specification to ensure accurate execution.

# Instruction Support:
The processor supports essential R-type, I-type, and J-type instructions, including arithmetic operations (add, sub), logical operations (and, or, slt), memory access (lw, sw), and control flow instructions (beq, j).
